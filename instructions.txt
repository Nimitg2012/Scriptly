 Step 1: Open Terminal and Navigate to Scriptly
bash
Copy code
cd ~/Desktop/scriptly
(Or wherever your scriptly folder is located.)

🌀 Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
This creates a venv/ folder inside scriptly.

🔁 Step 3: Activate the Virtual Environment
On macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
bash
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
After this, your terminal should show something like:

scss
Copy code
(venv) yourname@yourmac scriptly %
📦 Step 4: Install the Required Packages
Run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
This installs:

llama-cpp-python (for local code generation)

pyttsx3, speechrecognition, pyaudio (for voice support)

🚀 Step 5: Run Scriptly
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Now follow the prompts:

Type text or voice

Enter or say a Python code idea

Scriptly will generate the code and save it to output/

✅ Optional: Deactivate the Virtual Environment When Done
bash
Copy code
deactivate
🧪 Example Test Run
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Then type:

arduino
Copy code
text
Write a Python program that counts how many times a word appears in a text file
Check the output/ folder — it will contain the Python file.
